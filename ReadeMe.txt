This app analyze MAP file from NA tool, Sherlock output message files and trace from VUC-app-mode file.
If current ticket has symptoms some from master-ticket list, app will report it and will create a Duplicate.txt file,
with information for table in ContiJira system.
Also, if app didn`t find master-ticket, all issues will write to ALL_FAILS.txt file.

How to use:
1. If you have MAP file from NA tool, copy him to folder with app and rename map file to "MAP.txt"(very important).
2. If you have Sherlock output message files, copy them to folder with app.
3. if you have VUC-app-mode file, copy content from it and past into "VUC_App_Mode_logs.txt"(create VUC_App_Mode_logs.txt, it needs because VUC-app-mode file can be in .rtf or .doc format).

After this steps run Analyzer.exe. Goodluck!
